# Introduction

This is a mini project involving Unity. To make the ball jump, I used a script to first check whether the ball was on the ground by checking whether it was in contact with a collider or not. This prevents the ball from launching itself further up if it's not on the ground. 
The jumping mechanism uses Vector3's up function and some tweaks to the force and gravity to allow the ball to have a natural trajectory when going up and down. The rest of the movements are done with Vector2 and mapping the WASD keys to the respective directions.
